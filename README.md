# stm32-midi-footswitch

The goal of this project is to make a 4 button guitar pedal foot controller that reconciles an assortment of accessory switch methodologies.

Baseline features are:

* 4 momentary footswitches to trigger control functions
* 1 momentary footswitch to change mode
* LED with brightness control for each footswitch
* 1/4" TRS connector that ties together the tip and ring, and completes the circuit to the sleeve with different resistor values
* 5 pin DIN MIDI Out

Rumination on UX, stretch features, etc. is [here](dev-journal/design.md).
